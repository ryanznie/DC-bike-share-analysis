# DC-bike-share-analysis

This repository was created with the intentions of practicing my data science and machine learning skills. In 2022, I am now also using this bike sharing dataset to explore LSTM, a deep learning model great for predicting sequential and time series data.

## Motivations and results
As an avid bluebiker (the bike sharing service in Boston), I am curious about demands for bike sharing services year round. In Boston, some docking stations are removed in the winter to facilitate snow removal. From the data, it is clear that demands bike sharing services are seasonal, and it makes a lot of sense. No one wants to bike in frigid winds and terrible weather conditions.

## Data
This dataset was taken from Kaggle.
