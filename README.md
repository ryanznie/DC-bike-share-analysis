# DC-bike-share-analysis

As an avid bluebiker (bike sharing service in Boston), I am curious about demands for bike sharing services year round. In Boston, some docking stations are removed in the winter to facilitate snow removal. From the data, it is clear that demands bike sharing services are seasonal, and it makes a lot of sense. No one wants to bike in frigid winds and terrible weather conditions. I am using this dataset to practice my data analysis skills as well as to explore LSTM, a deep learning model great for predicting sequential and time series data.

This dataset is taken from Kaggle.
